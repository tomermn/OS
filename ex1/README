REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
the program creates a directory called "welcome_dir_1", inside this directory it creates
another directory called "welcome_dir_2", inside both directories it opens a new text file
called "welcome_file.txt".
inside the text file it writes "welcome to OS-2023".
finally it removes the text file and deletes both directories.

* while doing all these operations the program also handles memory alocations and dealocations,
 we didnt know if they should be described as well.
